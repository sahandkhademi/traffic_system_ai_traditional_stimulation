# Comparative Analysis: Traditional vs AI Traffic Light Systems

## Executive Summary

This report compares traditional fixed-time traffic light systems with AI-driven adaptive systems across 6 intersections over 3 days.

Key findings:
- **Wait Time Reduction**: AI systems reduced average vehicle wait times by 89.2%
- **Emergency Response**: Emergency vehicle wait times decreased by 83.2%
- **Fuel Efficiency**: Fuel consumption per vehicle reduced by 56.1%
- **Environmental Impact**: Emissions reduced by 74.7%

## Methodology

The simulation compared traditional fixed-time traffic signals with AI-driven adaptive systems under identical traffic conditions.
Key parameters included:
- Road types (suburban, highway)
- Different congestion levels (low, medium, high)
- Time-of-day traffic variations including peak hours
- Emergency vehicle scenarios

## Detailed Results

### 1. Traffic Flow Efficiency

Traditional system average wait time: 69.40 seconds (±19.17)
AI system average wait time: 7.50 seconds (±0.43)
Improvement: 89.2%

Statistical significance: p-value = 0.000000 (Significant at α=0.05)

95% Confidence Interval for wait time difference: 47.86 to 56.18 seconds
