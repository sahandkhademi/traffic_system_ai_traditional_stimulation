# Comparative Analysis: Traditional vs AI Traffic Light Systems

## Executive Summary

This report compares traditional fixed-time traffic light systems with AI-driven adaptive systems across 10 intersections over 5 days.

Key findings:
- **Wait Time Reduction**: AI systems reduced average vehicle wait times by 91.4%
- **Emergency Response**: Emergency vehicle wait times decreased by 82.0%
- **Fuel Efficiency**: Fuel consumption per vehicle reduced by 59.9%
- **Environmental Impact**: Emissions reduced by 76.6%

## Methodology

The simulation compared traditional fixed-time traffic signals with AI-driven adaptive systems under identical traffic conditions.
Key parameters included:
- Road types (suburban, highway)
- Different congestion levels (low, medium, high)
- Time-of-day traffic variations including peak hours
- Emergency vehicle scenarios

## Detailed Results

### 1. Traffic Flow Efficiency

Traditional system average wait time: 63.47 seconds (±29.37)
AI system average wait time: 5.48 seconds (±2.33)
Improvement: 91.4%

Statistical significance: p-value = 0.000000 (Significant at α=0.05)

95% Confidence Interval for wait time difference: 45.28 to 60.06 seconds
