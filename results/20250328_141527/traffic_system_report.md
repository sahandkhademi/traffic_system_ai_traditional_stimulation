# Comparative Analysis: Traditional vs AI Traffic Light Systems

## Executive Summary

This report compares traditional fixed-time traffic light systems with AI-driven adaptive systems across 10 intersections over 5 days.

Key findings:
- **Wait Time Reduction**: AI systems reduced average vehicle wait times by 73.0%
- **Emergency Response**: Emergency vehicle wait times decreased by 61.9%
- **Fuel Efficiency**: Fuel consumption per vehicle reduced by 41.6%
- **Environmental Impact**: Emissions reduced by 58.9%
- **Emergency Vehicle Preemption**: AI systems detected and preemptively responded to 59.9% of emergency vehicles

## Methodology

The simulation compared traditional fixed-time traffic signals with AI-driven adaptive systems under identical traffic conditions.
Key parameters included:
- Road types (suburban, highway)
- Different congestion levels (low, medium, high)
- Time-of-day traffic variations including peak hours
- Emergency vehicle scenarios

### Emergency Vehicle Handling
The simulation implements realistic emergency vehicle behavior:
- **Traditional system**: Emergency vehicles must slow down at intersections with red lights
- **AI system**: Includes emergency vehicle detection and preemptive signal control
  - Detects approaching emergency vehicles within detection range
  - Preemptively changes traffic signals to clear the path
  - Allows emergency vehicles to pass through intersections without stopping

## Detailed Results

### 1. Traffic Flow Efficiency

Traditional system average wait time: 34.49 seconds (±7.46)
AI system average wait time: 9.32 seconds (±3.80)
Improvement: 73.0%

Statistical significance: p-value = 0.000000 (Significant at α=0.05)

95% Confidence Interval for wait time difference: 48.85 to 54.70 seconds

### 2. Emergency Vehicle Response

Traditional system average emergency wait time: 3.62 seconds (±1.24)
AI system average emergency wait time: 1.38 seconds (±0.82)
Improvement: 61.9%

Statistical significance: p-value = 0.000000 (Significant at α=0.05)

95% Confidence Interval for emergency wait time difference: 2.14 to 2.36 seconds

Emergency vehicle detection rate: 59.9%
Average preemption activations per hour: 59.73

The AI system's ability to detect and preemptively respond to emergency vehicles significantly reduces response times, which can be critical in life-threatening situations.

### Impact of Realistic Emergency Vehicle Behavior

In real-world scenarios, emergency vehicles don't fully stop at red lights. This simulation reflects that reality:
- Traditional systems: Emergency vehicles slow down at intersections but proceed through red lights with caution
- AI systems: Proactively detect emergency vehicles and preemptively adjust signals to create a clear path

This realistic modeling shows that while both systems accommodate emergency vehicles, the AI system's preemptive approach results in significantly less slowdown and safer passage.
