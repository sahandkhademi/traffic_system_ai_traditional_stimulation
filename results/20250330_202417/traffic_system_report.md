# Comparative Analysis: Traditional vs AI Traffic Light Systems

## Executive Summary

This report compares traditional fixed-time traffic light systems with AI-driven adaptive systems across 20 intersections over 7 days.

Key findings:
- **Wait Time Reduction**: AI systems reduced average vehicle wait times by 72.8%
- **Emergency Response**: Emergency vehicle wait times decreased by 62.5%
- **Fuel Efficiency**: Fuel consumption per vehicle reduced by 41.5%
- **Environmental Impact**: Emissions reduced by 58.9%
- **Emergency Vehicle Preemption**: AI systems detected and preemptively responded to 59.9% of emergency vehicles

## Methodology

The simulation compared traditional fixed-time traffic signals with AI-driven adaptive systems under identical traffic conditions.
Key parameters included:
- Road types (suburban, highway)
- Different congestion levels (low, medium, high)
- Time-of-day traffic variations including peak hours
- Emergency vehicle scenarios

### Emergency Vehicle Handling
The simulation implements realistic emergency vehicle behavior:
- **Traditional system**: Emergency vehicles must slow down at intersections with red lights
- **AI system**: Includes emergency vehicle detection and preemptive signal control
  - Detects approaching emergency vehicles within detection range
  - Preemptively changes traffic signals to clear the path
  - Allows emergency vehicles to pass through intersections without stopping

## Detailed Results

### 1. Traffic Flow Efficiency

Traditional system average wait time: 33.70 seconds (±7.43)
AI system average wait time: 9.16 seconds (±3.66)
Improvement: 72.8%

Statistical significance: p-value = 0.000000 (Significant at α=0.05)

95% Confidence Interval for wait time difference: 48.80 to 54.78 seconds

### Day-to-Day Patterns

The analysis reveals consistent performance improvements across all days of the simulation:
- AI system maintains lower wait times throughout the entire period
- Consistent day-to-day performance indicates the system's reliability
- See "Average Wait Time by Day" visualization for detailed daily comparison

### 2. Emergency Vehicle Response

Traditional system average emergency wait time: 3.64 seconds (±1.28)
AI system average emergency wait time: 1.37 seconds (±0.84)
Improvement: 62.5%

Statistical significance: p-value = 0.000000 (Significant at α=0.05)

95% Confidence Interval for emergency wait time difference: 2.20 to 2.35 seconds

Emergency vehicle detection rate: 59.9%
Average preemption activations per hour: 55.48

The AI system's ability to detect and preemptively respond to emergency vehicles significantly reduces response times, which can be critical in life-threatening situations.

### Impact of Realistic Emergency Vehicle Behavior

In real-world scenarios, emergency vehicles don't fully stop at red lights. This simulation reflects that reality:
- Traditional systems: Emergency vehicles slow down at intersections but proceed through red lights with caution
- AI systems: Proactively detect emergency vehicles and preemptively adjust signals to create a clear path

This realistic modeling shows that while both systems accommodate emergency vehicles, the AI system's preemptive approach results in significantly less slowdown and safer passage.
