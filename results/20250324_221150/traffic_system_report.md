# Comparative Analysis: Traditional vs AI Traffic Light Systems

## Executive Summary

This report compares traditional fixed-time traffic light systems with AI-driven adaptive systems across 20 intersections over 7 days.

Key findings:
- **Wait Time Reduction**: AI systems reduced average vehicle wait times by 85.2%
- **Emergency Response**: Emergency vehicle wait times decreased by 0.0%
- **Fuel Efficiency**: Fuel consumption per vehicle reduced by 30.2%
- **Environmental Impact**: Emissions reduced by 47.6%

## Methodology

The simulation compared traditional fixed-time traffic signals with AI-driven adaptive systems under identical traffic conditions.
Key parameters included:
- Road types (suburban, highway)
- Different congestion levels (low, medium, high)
- Time-of-day traffic variations including peak hours
- Emergency vehicle scenarios

## Detailed Results

### 1. Traffic Flow Efficiency

Traditional system average wait time: 40.29 seconds (±231.40)
AI system average wait time: 5.96 seconds (±87.92)
Improvement: 85.2%

Statistical significance: p-value = 0.903793 (Not significant at α=0.05)

95% Confidence Interval for wait time difference: 23.97 to 46.95 seconds
