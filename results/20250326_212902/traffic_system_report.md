# Comparative Analysis: Traditional vs AI Traffic Light Systems

## Executive Summary

This report compares traditional fixed-time traffic light systems with AI-driven adaptive systems across 6 intersections over 3 days.

Key findings:
- **Wait Time Reduction**: AI systems reduced average vehicle wait times by 87.5%
- **Emergency Response**: Emergency vehicle wait times decreased by 83.5%
- **Fuel Efficiency**: Fuel consumption per vehicle reduced by 55.5%
- **Environmental Impact**: Emissions reduced by 74.3%

## Methodology

The simulation compared traditional fixed-time traffic signals with AI-driven adaptive systems under identical traffic conditions.
Key parameters included:
- Road types (suburban, highway)
- Different congestion levels (low, medium, high)
- Time-of-day traffic variations including peak hours
- Emergency vehicle scenarios

## Detailed Results

### 1. Traffic Flow Efficiency

Traditional system average wait time: 59.26 seconds (±19.18)
AI system average wait time: 7.41 seconds (±0.55)
Improvement: 87.5%

Statistical significance: p-value = 0.000000 (Significant at α=0.05)

95% Confidence Interval for wait time difference: 47.59 to 56.60 seconds
